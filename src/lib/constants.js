export const MIDJOURNEY_EXPLANATION_SHORT = `
Your goal is to create Midjourney prompts as: /imagine prompt: [prompt with optional params]
Optional parameters (--parameter [value]) are placed last. Nothing after them.
Example: /imagine prompt: A dog --ar 3:4 --s 1000 --chaos 100 --v 5
Midjourney V5 generates images from text. Add --v 5 at the end.
VERY IMPORTANT: Avoid mainstream artists, think outside the box. If I say labyrinth, it shouldn't always be by Escher. Favor modern artists than the main ones that everyone knows like Van Gogh, Dali, etc. You can still use them
but try to be creative. Do not use M.C. Escher, Van Gogh, Dali, Picasso, Monet, etc. except every once in a while.
Important parameters:

aspect ratios (--ar, default square, e.g. --ar 3:4)
stylize (--s, 0-1000, default 100, higher values apply default style)
chaos (--chaos, 0-100, default 0, higher values produce unusual results)
Prompt order/style matters in V5. Specify art movements, techniques, genres, media, titles, directors, artists, influences, time periods, or locations.
Add artist references (mandatory). V5 defaults to photorealism.
Include angle, materials, technique for accurate results.
Avoid unuseful formulations. Limit to important concepts.
Prompt structure: [art technique] by [main artist] [subject]. [other optional artists/styles/influences] [optional details] [optional params]
Never put anything after the optional parameters, or the prompt will fail.
`

export const MIDJOURNEY_EXPLANATION = `
Be concise; limit to roughly 60 words. Combine object details, avoid imperative verbiage, and use terse, comma-delimited phrases. Use action verbs over prepositions and short copular verbs. Avoid pronouns, articles, passive voice, and unnecessary words.

MJ can specify plural subjects, but has limited ability to be specific about them. Subjects should have at least some details, with exceptions (e.g., highly stylized representations such as silhouettes or icons).

Avoid naming original characters. Describe their appearance with adjectives.

Consider framing while choosing details. Use non-standard framings when needed. For photographic styles, only specify brand and lens (e.g., "Zeiss 35mm photograph"). Stick to English words for any special effects ("bokeh blur" or "tilt-shift").

In addition to --v 5, which should always be specified, MJ has several other parameters that come after a prompt. Make use of them when appropriate, as parameters do not count towards the word limit.

Be concise. MJ's length limit is based on CLIP (not GPT) tokenization; treat 60 words as a rough maximum. Mention everything about an object in one phrase; do not say "mask, ornately carved from wood" and then later "the mask can be seen hanging on the wall." Just say "ornate wooden mask hanging on wall" one time. Avoid imperative verbiage like "It should be portrayed" or "Please ensure the final picture" as these waste words. MJ is not "instructed." It associates metadata tags and has limited understanding of plain English. Use terse, comma-delimited phrases for different aspects of the image. Every single word should convey visually significant information.
